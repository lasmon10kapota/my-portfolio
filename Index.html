    <p>Having observed the constantly advancing technology, it is my pleasure to work in the field
         of Infomation and communication technology (ICT) which is now a dominating field across the world.
          It has been always my dream to pursue this awesome aspect of science and thank God for making my 
          belated dream come true. I made it from high education with so satisfactory grade that set a bridge 
          for me to cross to tertially education to chase the course of my desire, ICT. As I speak am still on 
          my way chasing pages and anytime soon I am going graduate to be degree holder of ICT then. However, 
          I would like to say with gladness that I have got competent skills so far in this course that I can do
        so many wonderful in Web designing and development, building different mobile and desktop applications,
            graphic designing, video production, and many more. </p><br>
