              Having observed the constantly advancing technology, it is my pleasure to work in the field
              of Infomation and communication technology (ICT) which is now the only dominating field across the world.
              It has been always my dream to pursue this awesome aspect of science and thank God for making my 
              belated dream come true. I made it from high education with so satisfactory grade that set a bridge 
              for me to cross to tertially education to chase the course of my desire, ICT. As I speak am still on 
              my way chasing pages at Mzuzu University in Malawi and anytime soon I am going graduate to be degree holder of ICT then. However, 
              I would like to say with gladness that I have got competent skills so far in this course that I can do
              so many wonderful things like Web designing and development, building different mobile and desktop applications,
              graphic designing, video production, and many more. My vision is to uplift technological life by providing
              people from different parts of the world with more sophisticated information technology that will make life easier and enjoyable.
